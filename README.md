[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/direktspeed/mosaico.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/direktspeed/mosaico)

Mosaico is a [DoneJS](https://donejs.com) app that enables users to coordinate
the players, teams, games, rounds and recordings of a basketball tournament.
It also serves as an example of how to use DoneJS with sessions, user
privileges, RESTful services, and ORM models.

If you want to run and build plain old mosaico we stayed compatible with it at present
- host /mosaico directly
- src /mosaico grunt build:old


If you want to run the new fresh with own backend.
- npm install && npm start
- optinal updates - src /mosaico grunt build our mosaico src automaticly updates /public/mosaico

------

To run the Mosaico app locally, run its tests, or generate its documentation
follow the steps outlined below.

### Setup Environment

Make sure you have installed:

- [Node 7](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- NPM 3 *(packaged with Node)*
- OPTIONAL -[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### Download Source

Clone this repo using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/direktspeed/mosaico.git
```

Navigate to the repository's directory

```
cd mosaico
```

### Prepare the Database SQLite
- npm install
- npm run db-migrate

### Prepare REMOTE the Database

Make sure the `postgres` process is running:

```
ps | grep postgres
```

You should see "postgres -D" among the output:

```
92831 ttys000    0:00.02 postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
92856 ttys000    0:00.00 grep postgres
```

With that confirmed we can create the database that the mosaico app
will persist its data to:

```
createdb mosaico
```

### Install Dependencies

To install the project's JavaScript dependencies run:

```
npm install
```

### Docker

We bundle a small Dockerfile based on centos7 to test mosaico with no need to install dependencies.
```
docker build -t mosaico/mosaico .
docker run -p 9006:9006 mosaico/mosaico
```
then open a browser to point to the port 9006 of your docker machine IP.

### Serving via Apache PHP or Django?
First you have to build it using grunt, then you can read (https://github.com/voidlabs/mosaico/wiki/Serving-Mosaico).



Additionally DoneJS's command line utilities need to be installed globally:
if you want to use donejs * commands

```
npm install -g donejs-cli
```

### Start the Server

With all the prerequisite setup completed the server can be started by running:

```
npm start
# Optional - donejs start
```

### Register a User

Navigate to [http://localhost:5000/register](http://localhost:5000/register)
in your browser and follow the instructions.

### Enjoy

You're finished! Explore some of the app's features:

- Live reload (`npm run develop`) OR (`donejs develop`)
- Run the tests (`npm test`) OR (`donejs test`)
- Generate the documentation (`npm run document`) OR (`donejs document`)
